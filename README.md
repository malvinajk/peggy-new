## Overview

This project is an interactive portfolio display for a client that arranges project titles in an elliptic layout. Users can scroll / drag to rotate the ellipse, focus on individual projects, and view a larger title in the center. 

It explores state driven rendering and geometric positioning without any external libraries. Items are distributed along an ellipse using parametric equations and dynamically re-rendered based on rotation state. Label orientation follows the ellipse tangent for consistent curve alignement.

## Features
- Scroll based rotation of the ellipse;
- Dynamic rotation logic with tangent-based label alignement;
- Highlight/focus effect for selected project;
- Dynamic title display in the center;
- Responsive radii recalculation based on the viewport dimensions;

## Technologies Used

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) for interactive logic and DOM manipulation;
- CSS for animations and scroll trigger;
