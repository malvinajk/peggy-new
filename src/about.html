            <p>Peggy Atherton is a sculptor and a contemporary artist based in the UK. She is interested in how contemporary society relates to nature, cycles of life and decay. Using road kill animals as materials, she creates odd circumstances through gestures, rituals, materials or colours. Her sustained involvement with the processes of sculpture-making carries a playfulness. Disparate mix of elements, sometimes cast and sometimes presented in their own natural state, by juxtaposing mortality and hope with hints of humour. Found rabbits and a discarded Nike rucksack are cast together to create a narrative of the past and present. A complex relationship that is particularly pertinent with regards to global ecology and our impact on the environment.</p>
